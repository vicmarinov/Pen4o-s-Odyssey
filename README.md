===============

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the *Pen4o’s Odyssey* series, which were created and provided by [Alexandrina Mehandzhiyska](https://github.com/alexmehandzhiyska) during my [Programming Basics with JavaScript](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4882/programming-basics-with-javascript-january-2025) course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg).

*Pen4o’s Odyssey* is a series of fun and engaging programming problems designed to help students deepen their understanding of the material covered in SoftUni’s [Programming Basics with JavaScript](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4882/programming-basics-with-javascript-january-2025) course and explore additional JavaScript capabilities.
